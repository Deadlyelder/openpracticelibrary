whatIs: Creativity Warmups are a set of quick, creative thinking activities that
  act as a mental warmup to stretch the group's creative thinking.
whyDo: >-
  Taking time to stretch the team's creative thinking is a fantastic way to get
  more creative ideas from an ideation session for your product, service, or
  project team. Completing any of these mini practices helps expand thinking and
  can lead to even more creative and innovative ideas.\

  \

  Creativity Warmups are based on the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT). **The TTCT (Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking)** assess how creatively a childâ€™s mind works and are often given to children to determine advanced placement or as part of an entrance examination. They are very different from intelligence and reasoning tests your child may have already taken. Instead of traditionally taught subjects such as reading or math, these tests assess creativity. Children are scored on a number of aspects. This includes:


  * Creative titles for pictures

  * Expressions

  * Imagery

  * and Humor

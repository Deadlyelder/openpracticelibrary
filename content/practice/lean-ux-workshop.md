## What is it? 

In a Lean UX workshop, participants practice interviewing and learning about a user. Then, they prototype and refine a product that solves a real problem faced by that person. 

## Why use it? 

This practice helps build a culture of user-centered design and lean UX. It's a hands-on activity that can provide a break from presentations or technical workshops. It's also a great icebreaker!

## How to facilitate it

Before each step, spend a minute or two explaining what participants will do next and answering questions.

- Introduce Lean UX and user-centered design. Depending on the audience, consider one or more of the following (10-15 minutes):
  - Demonstrate a mock user interview
  - Show a short video
  - Describe an experience practicing user-centered design.
- Divide people into groups of 3: User, Designer, Developer
- The designer interviews the user. (3 min)
    - The designer asks user about his or her morning routine (from waking up to arriving at work).
  - The interviewer looks for a problem that the user ran into and asks open-ended questions to learn more.
- Developer and desinger prototype solution to the problem using Lego. (7 min)
- Developer and designer present solution to user and get feedback. If possible, let the user try out the product! (3 min)
- Refine the Lego solution, and gather additional feedback. (7 min)
- Have two or three teams present their solutions. (5 minutes)

The facilitator should move from table to table to make sure teams are progressing. If teams finish early, they can build another prototype and A/B test the solution.

### Tips

Consider writing these on a whiteboard.

- Ask open-ended questions - not closed (yes/no) questions.
- Use the "ladder" technique - keep asking "why" to learn more.
- When you have something to measure, use ratings on on a scale from 1 to 11. This helps participants give honest feedback instead of thinking of the rating like a grade in school.

- [Lean UX](https://www.jeffgothelf.com/lean-ux-book/) by Jeff Gothelf covers the overall "How" and "Why" behind this activity.
- [Design Thinking 101](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/) digs into the feedback loop used in this exercise. The Nielsen Norman group calls it "Understand, Explore, Materialize", but it's very similar to the "Build, Measure, Learn" loop from [Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/).
- [Usability Testing](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/usability-testing/) is similar to the open-ended interview we practice here.

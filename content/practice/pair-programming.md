## What is it?

* An agile practice where two team members work together on one workstation (one keyboard and mouse) to implement a feature. 

## Why use it?

* Enable knowledge sharing between team members.
* Increased quality of work as it is reviewed and improved simultaneously.
* Building of trust between team members.

It is not for:

* Teaching domain
* Mentorship
* Showing code
* Getting confirmation
* Finding bugs

## How to do it?

* The team member behind the keyboard and mouse is the *driver*. The *driver* is focused on performing the actual work.
* The other team member is the *navigator* or *observer.* The *navigator* is focused on the strategic outcome of the work being performed.
* The *navigator* reviews the work being performed by the *driver* as it is done.
* While reviewing, the *navigator* keeps in mind the end goal and ensures the current task is working towards it.
* Switch the roles often, for example every 15 minutes, for the team members to experience the different aspects of the work.

## What is it?

The leaders or bosses get their food **last**.

## Why use it?

To show that leaders are responsible for other human beings, and to ensure that the team knows they will be taken care of by their leaders. It helps build trust between leaders and teams.

## Further Information

Based on Simon Sinek's book "Leaders Eat Last: Why Some Teams Pull Together and Others Don't"

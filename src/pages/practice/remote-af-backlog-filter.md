  The priority validation canvas is a tool used to surface high risk work items.
  This canvas looks at work through the lens of complexity by focusing on the
  teams' knowledge. Understanding which work items need attention allows
  managers to intervene.


  In most cases, this will lead to identifying and prioritizing the most unknown work higher in the backlog. Doing this will de-risk the backlog and improve predictability for the team. As with all remote:af patterns, the backlog filter is designed to be effective regardless of context and can be used across many types of teams.
whyDo: >-
  Common signals for using the remote:af backlog filter are;


  * the team has recently received a new backlog of work

  * the team needs to deliver work outside their regular expertise

  * the work's sponsor (e.g. Product Owner) needs to understand the risk profile of the work

  * the team has struggled with forecasting work effectively
howTo: >-
  Step 1: filter work


  Map the backlog of work on to the matrix based on the criteria around the edges.

## What is it?

* An agile practice where two team members work together on one workstation (one keyboard and mouse) to implement a feature. 

## Why use it?

* Enable knowledge sharing between more experienced and less experienced team members.
* Increased quality of work as it is reviewed and improved simultaneously.
* Building of trust between team members.

## How to do it?

* The team member behind the keyboard and mouse is the _driver_. The _driver_ is focused on performing the actual work.
* The other team member is the _navigator_ or _observer._ The _navigator_ is focused on the strategic outcome of the work being performed.
* The _navigator_ reviews the work being performed by the _driver_ as it is done.
* While reviewing, the _navigator_ keeps in mind the end goal and ensures the current task is working towards it.
* Switch the roles often, for example every 15 minutes, for the team members to experience the different aspects of the work.

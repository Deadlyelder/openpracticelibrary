whatIs: "This is a tool for a team to collect topics: What we know, what we
  want  to learn, and then prioritise among possible knowledge sharing topics."
whyDo: This is a practical way to quickly gather knowledge among the team and
  gauge what the team knows and where are the knowledge gaps other team members
  can fill. Done regularly, this will help the team to gain knowledge and create
  an open culture.
howTo: >-
  ***Individually/asynchronous*** 

  1. Select a column, fill in your name on top

  2. At the top section of your space fill in sticky notes for topics you wish to share, can teach or recently learned about, worth sharing

  3. At the bottom section of your space fill in topics you are interested learning more about


  ***During a team gathering***

  1. Notice the small emoji next to your name. After each participant added their wish list of topics of what they want to learn, review each topic. If you can share on the subject, please put your name+emoji on the sticker

  2. Review the requested knowledge gaps topics, group together similar topics/stickers

  3. We will use voting to decide what will be the next topic. Each participant gets 4 dots to vote on possible next topic to be shared/learnt. The highest topic will be the top on the agenda.

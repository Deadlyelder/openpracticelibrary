## What is it?

* A tool to capture and visualise what key stakeholders are sensing when in a particular context or completing a set of tasks.
* A way to form a better understanding of users and build personas
* The information is captured directly from interviews, observation and other facilitated conversation exercises.
* Senses captured can include what the person is seeing, thinking, doing and feeling with information captured on a big visible chart.



## Why use it?

* Captures information and learning directly from the end user affected by the system/application/solution in question.
* Enables a direct connection between important stakeholders and developers (for example, developers of an application can learn directly from end users using it).
* A tool to identify pain points, opportunities and starts to form a basis for improvement and optimisation. 
* An excellent tool to move from user empathy to value propositions - Dave Gray has integrated Alex Osterwalder's Value Proposition Canvas in the latest version of the Empathy Map

whatIs: The "What If..." practice is a team activity seeks to identify the
  current "rules" or "norms" surrounding a particular challenge, then eliminate
  one of those rules or norms to broaden the spectrum of innovative ideas. This
  practice was created by former Head of Innovation and Creativity at Disney,
  Duncan Wardle, and was heavily used during his time at the company.
whyDo: This practice is a proven activity for lightly challenging peoples'
  mental barriers surrounding a particular business challenge. These mental
  barriers, or "river of thinking," forms over time as we work in a particular
  industry. Through our experiences, we subconciously begin to form patterns in
  what we think something should look like, and these patterns begin to form
  boundaries for creativity. The "What If..." practice seeks to identify those
  boundaries and experiment with removing one of them so we can find even more
  creative and innovative ideas to problem solving.
howTo: >-
  1. Choose a challenge topic to focus on for the session (a problem statement,
  customer journey, industry you're operating in, etc)

  2. Using wall space, a whiteboard, or your favorite digital whiteboarding tool, draw lines to form 3 columns and label them "Rules," "What If...," and "Imagine If..." (from left to right)

  3. Give everyone on the team a pad of stickies and a sharpie (if running this in person)

  4. Set a timer for 5 minutes and have participants list out all the rules, norms, and barriers related to that particular challenge (1 idea per stickie)

  5. After the timer goes off, read through all the ideas, then give everyone 3 dots for voting

  6. Set timer for 2 minutes and have everyone vote on the rule(s) they think that, if eliminated, would most broaden the spectrum of ideation. Take the top-voted stickie and move it to the "What If..." column

  7. Ask the team to think to themselves "What if this rule didn't apply?" On a separate stickie, reword the rule to create a provocative statement that answers that question

  8. Set a timer for 10 minutes and have everyone write down ideas for what a

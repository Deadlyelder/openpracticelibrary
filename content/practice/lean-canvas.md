# What is it?

The lean canvas template is a one -pager, which captures key information about your future product, what problem it will solve, who are your customers, how will you distribute it and how you will make money from it.

## Why use it?

Ash Maurya modified the Business Model Canvas (by Alexander Osterwalder) with the aim to shorten the product development lifecycle and rapidly discover if the proposed business model is viable.

It will help you establish if your product or service idea has merits.

When filling out the canvas it is best to fill them out in a certain way. Follow the numbers in the boxes.

Ensure to use bullet points – not long sentences – a good canvas should be understood in a few minutes

Make sure you are filling out every box, there might be a lot of uncertainty but the canvas is there to help you.

## What is it?

Ping-Pong Programming (aka. Ping-Pong Pair Programming) is a kind of [Pair Programming](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/pair-programming/) that uses TDD ([Test Driven Development](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/test-driven-development/)) while in practice. In other words, it is a combination of Pair Programming and TDD.

## Why use it?

In addition to the Pair Programming's own benefits, Ping-Pong Pair Programming has the following advantages:

* Easier to find the rythm of the development flow which can be a problem when it comes to switching pairs.
* A much smaller problem space needs to be managed, so this enables developers to sync with the flow quicker than other styles.

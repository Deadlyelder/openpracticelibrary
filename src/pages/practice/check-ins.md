whatIs: Checkins are
whyDo: Why is this important? It gives everyone a chance to speak and share. It
  tests out microphones etc and sets the expectation that everyone can talk.
howTo: >-
  Simply ask the following:


  * How are you doing?

  * How are you really doing?

  * Random non-work related question e.g.: What do you hope to get out of this call/meeting/workshop?

  * Pass on to someone else :)




  If you're pairing this with a standup, the following questions are great for sharing information and for accountability and creating feedback loops!


  * What are your intentions for the day?

  * How did yesterday’s intentions go?

  * Do you see any blockers to our progress?

  * What’s something that you’re grateful for in the team?

  * What’s one thing you’d like help/advice with?

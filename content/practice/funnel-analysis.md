## What is it?

Funnel Analysis is an analytical practice studying the changes over a course of events, steps in a user journey and/or flow inside an application towards achieving a specific goal. Consider the purchasing of an item on an ecommerce site: the funnel analysis will show how many users go through the full flow of steps to complete a purchase and how many are stopping and at which step (fallout rates). 

The Funnel Analysis is an effective way to analyse conversion and fallout in applications, which is a good way tp measure performance.

This practice is fed with data from A/B Testing, Multi-vari Testing, which in turn are most probably the result of Design of Experiments. Feature Toggles can greatly benefit the analysis as they can be used to tweak the application based on live feed of data. 

The analysis is the final step before decision-making analysing the impact of the different changes the team experimented with. It aims to produce actionable insight on how the team can further improve the performance of the product and the impact of past changes. 



## Why use it?

This is a feedback loop practice, which allows the team to get prompt feedback from real life use of their changes. 

Funnel Analysis provides a way for benchmarking of similar products.

It enables objective, data-informed decision-making in product teams. 

When carefully followed over time, the analysis can reveal the real impact of product/feature changes, both positive and negative. 

This is one of the practices that allow you to “tune the engine” and carry “innovation accounting” as per The Lean Startup by Eric Reis.

The practice provides an objective criteria for important decisions on the product design, features, behaviour, etc. It is used as a way to enhance the product performance, the user experience and the business outcomes the product produces for your organization.

  Mood Marbles is a team culture practice that allows each person within a group
  to communicate how they are feeling at any point in time by using various
  colored stickies on a chart. The chart (physical or digital) is accessible to
  all team members and is populated with 1 of 3 colored stickies by every team
  member.\

  \

  These stickies correspond to psychological and emotional states:\

  Green = I'm feeling good! Let's keep goin!\

  Yellow = I'm a little nervous or uncertain, but ok to continue\

  Red = I don't feel comfortable or safe right now\

  \

  Stickies are anonymous and represent the current state of the team at any given time.
whyDo: Providing an anonymous means for team members to communicate how they're
  feeling is a great way to gauge psychological safety. While simple on the
  surface, Mood Marbles is a great way to identify cultural red flags that might
  pop up as a team works together. As a faciltator, you can keep an eye on the
  Mood Marbles chart to know if the team is feeling safe and comfortable working
  together, or if there needs to be a discussion or retrospective to tease out
  details about something that is causing an issue within the team.

whatIs: The Spaghetti Wall is a physical or digital workspace that is set up as
  a place to capture budding ideas/challenges in your organization. As we go
  about our work, we encounter pain points and problems that, if solved, would
  help improve our way of working. Likewise, we may have "aha" moments for a
  incremental or even disruptive innovation. The Spaghetti Wall is a designated
  space where these problems and ideas can be captured at any time. See what
  sticks!
whyDo: Visualizing these problems and ideas creates transparency and
  collaboration within the organization, as well as ensures we are always
  seeking ways to improve our way of working. At its best, it also serves as a
  starting point for new ideas to mature through collaboration. Colleagues can
  visit the Spaghetti Wall at any time and quickly align on current problems and
  ideas the rest of the organization is capturing and working on. They can
  naturally gravitate toward the problems they are drawn to and help mature the
  idea by adding clarifying questions and ideas to the wall. This gives your
  problem-solvers and dreamers and outlet to utilize their skillset to help
  drive organizational impact as well as strengthen your culture of innovation
  and collaboration.

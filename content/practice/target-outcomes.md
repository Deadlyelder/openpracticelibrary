## What is it?

* A tool to capture and articulate the goals and outcomes a team are striving to deliver.
* Can include customer (end user) based outcomes as well as business and capability based outcomes.
* Often harnesses and summarises the findings and learnings from other Discovery practices into a finite set of statements that can be publicly displayed for team and stakeholders to regularly reference.



## Why use it?

* Helps achieve alignment and focus across stakeholder groups and team members.
* Helps focus on achieving measurable customer and business outcomes / impacts as opposed to purely outputs.
* Provides a visual reminder to all on the current outcomes of focus and can be used to help with prioritisation / filtering of upcoming work items.

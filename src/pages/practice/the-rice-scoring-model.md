  The RICE s is a simple technique used to scoring Model **prioritize projects
  or decisions**. It stands for:


  * **R - Reach:** This refers to the number of people who will be impacted by the decision or project.

  * **I - Impact:** This considers the severity or importance of the effect the decision or project will have.

  * **C - Confidence:** This estimates the level of effort, time, and resources required to implement the decision or project. It's essentially your level of certainty about the outcome.

  * **E - Effort:** This represents the urgency or importance of the decision or project compared to others.

  **Simplicity:** Easy to understand and apply, even for those without extensive
  decision-making experience.



  **Transparency:** The scoring and comparison process is clear, promoting communication and understanding of prioritization choices.



  **Flexibility:** Adaptable to different situations by adjusting the relative importance of each criterion.

  **Step 1: Define Your Projects or Decisions**


  * List all the projects or decisions you need to prioritize. Be clear and concise in describing each option.


  **Step 2: Establish Scoring Criteria**


  * Decide on a scoring system for each of the RICE factors (Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort). This can be a simple scale like 1-5 (low to high) or a more nuanced system with decimals.

  * Clearly define what each score on the scale represents for each criterion. For example, a score of "5" for Reach might represent impacting thousands of people, while a score of "1" might represent impacting a small team.


  **Step 3: Assign Scores**


  * Work through each project or decision on your list and assign a score for each RICE factor.

  * Discuss and agree on the scores as a team if possible, considering different perspectives.


  **Step 4: Calculate RICE Scores**


  * Once you have assigned individual scores for Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort, multiply these scores together for each project or decision. This will give you a total RICE score.


  **Step 5: Compare and Prioritize**


  * Compare the total RICE scores for all your projects or decisions.

  * Generally, projects or decisions with higher RICE scores are considered more important and should be prioritized higher.

## What is it?

Test automation allows teams to remove the slow and manual testing cycles related to software development. Test automation can include such things as:

* Static code analysis
* Linting
* Unit tests
* End to end test
* Security tests

These tests as typically executed by build automation tool for example Jenkins. Easy and quick tests should be ran right after building (compiling) your application, such as unit tests and static code analysis. Also many of these tests can be run in parallel decreasing the overall time taken to run the tests.

## Why use it?

* Increases the code quality
* Faster feedback loop
* Tells you if your change broke some previously working code

## How to do it?

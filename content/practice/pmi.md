## What is it?

PMI is a quick and easy way to get people thinking for a retrospective.  It can also be used at the end of the day as a team checkin for past paced intensive work sessions, and can be used to group populate an engagement journal.

## Why use it?

It promotes "And" thinking.  Not just good, or bad, but points of interest too, it invites people to reflect in what happened without necessarily judging those events as good or bad. But it still lets people vent and celebrate as necessary.

## Further Information

Edward de Bono gets the credit for this one.

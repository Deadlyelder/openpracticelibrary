whatIs: PESTEL analysis is a framework for scanning the environment for factors
  that could impact an organization's market, business position, and/or
  operational strategies.
whyDo: >-
  PESTEL analysis is particularly useful before embarking on any new strategy
  (ex. new line of business, new geographic market, business transformation,
  etc.).  


  It is also useful to periodically perform PESTEL analysis for existing business lines and/or markets.  Changes in the environment may present new opportunities (or threats!) to existing operations.


  PESTEL analysis naturally feeds into other strategy setting practices like SWOT Analysis, Five Forces Analysis, and/or [Target Outcomes](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/target-outcomes/).


  Reviewing context from multiple lenses in a single analysis builds a shared understanding that individuals may not understand otherwise.  (Ex. business staff understand technology trends, technical staff understand economic factors, etc.)
howTo: >-
  1. Identify scope for analysis (business unit, whole company, etc.) with
  sponsor and/or key stakeholders

  2. Pull together a diverse group of experts to obtain a broad set (ideally with internal and external participants)

  3. Brainstorm environmental factors, trends, and/or changes from the following six lenses:

     * **P**olitical and governmental factors (ex. tariffs, political stability, etc.)
     * **E**conomic and monetary factors (ex. economic growth/contraction, inflation, etc.)
     * **S**ocioCultural factors (ex. demographic shifts, , ESG Active investors, etc.)
     * **T**echnological factors (ex. rise of public cloud, IoT, global connectivity, new security threats, etc.)
     * **E**nvironmental or ecological factors (ex. COVID-19, drought/flooding, etc.)
     * **L**egal factors (ex. GDPR, data sovereignty, etc.)
  4. Aggregate / [Affinity map](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/affinity-mapping/) similar factors.  Discuss/restate all factors to ensure all participants share understanding.

  5. Identify the most impactful factors to the organization (ex. using dot voting)

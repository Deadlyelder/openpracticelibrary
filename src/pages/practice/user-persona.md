whatIs: >-
  U﻿ser Persona are carefully crafted, fictional characters created based on
  thorough research to r﻿epresent the diverse user types who might interact with
  your service, product, website, or brand.


  These personas are not mere hypothetical users but are constructed to represent key traits of large segments of your audience, including demographics, behaviour patterns, motivations, and goals.
whyDo: >-
  User personas guide product teams to make informed decisions based on user
  needs and preferences. They are essential in prioritising features, designing
  interfaces, and creating marketing strategies that resonate with the target
  audience.


  User personas help in building a shared understanding of users within the team and avoid design based on assumptions or personal biases.
howTo: >-
  **1. Conduct Research and Identify User Characteristics**


  * Perform extensive research through surveys, interviews, and market analysis to gather detailed information about target users.

  * Analyse and identify key qualities, behaviours, and distinctive traits among user segments


  **2. Formulate User Groups and Secure Stakeholder Consensus**


  * Develop initial hypotheses about potential user groups from your research findings.

  * Collaborate with stakeholders to gain consensus on these user hypotheses and the overall direction for persona development.


  **3. Define and Detail Multiple Personas**


  *﻿ Agree on the type of persona that is more relevant for your product and scenario. Some widely used persona types include:

   ﻿ * The Goal-Directed Persona:

    Examples:
    Retirement Ready Robert: A persona focused on financial security and retirement planning.
    Budget Conscious Brenda: A character who prioritizes cost-efficiency and budget-friendly solutions.
   ﻿ * 

  * Agree upon and focus on a select number of personas, ideally one or two key ones, while acknowledging others.

  * For each persona, include:
    * A visual representation, such as a photo or illustration.
    * In-depth background details covering values, interests, education, lifestyle, needs, attitudes, desires, limitations, goals, and behaviour patterns.
    * A narrative or story that brings the persona to life and fosters empathy.

  **4. Contextualise Personas with Scenarios**


  * Craft scenarios demonstrating how each persona would interact with your product, emphasising their specific problems, needs, and use cases.


  **5. Encourage Collaborative Involvement**


  * Engage the entire project team in the process of reviewing, accepting, and providing feedback on the personas.

  * Distribute the finalised personas among team members to ensure their integration into project workflows and decision-making.



  **6. Ensure Regular Updates and Adjustments**


  * Commit to an ongoing process of refining and updating the personas, incorporating new insights and evolving market trends.

  * Be prepared to add new features or personas and to retire those that become less relevant over time.

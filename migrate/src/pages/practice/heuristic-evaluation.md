## What is it? 
Heuristic evaluation is a method for reviewing designs based on ten basic principles. The term was [coined by Jakob Neilsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) back in 1995, but the principles are still just as relevant today.

## Why use it? 
- Provide expert review of designs, which can be a great companion to feedback from usability testing.
- It can be difficult to provide useful design critiques. These heuristics help reviewers provide concrete, actionable feedback.

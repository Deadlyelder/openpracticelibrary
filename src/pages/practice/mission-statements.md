whatIs: T﻿he Mission statement is starting point of crafting a strategy for any
  type of organization, entity.  It can be use as part of a large customer
  engagement as well.  It is a brief statement (typically one or two sentences)
  that defines why the organization exist.  It should be inspirational, clear
  statement that explains and drives the organization to an overall strategic
  destination.
whyDo: A Mission statement defines the fundamental purpose of an organization,
  entity or engagement.  It should inform executives and employees about the
  overall goal they have come together to realize as a team.  It serves as the
  ultimate alignment tool what the organization is trying to accomplish.
howTo: >-
  The Mission Statement can be created from a client meeting, series of
  interviews, standalone facilitated practice or as part of a workshop. The goal
  of this process is to identify the overarching reason why the organization,
  entity or engagement was originally established.


  **Interviews**


  D﻿uring interviews with customer sponsors for an engagement or executives of an entity, the interviewer should focus on main concepts in crafting a Mission statement.  Those concepts are address via the questions listed below:


  1. W﻿hy do we exist?

  2. W﻿ho does the organization/engagement serve?

  3. W﻿hy does the organization/engagement care?


  *H﻿int: Use the questions above as a start to an interview guide for each executive.  Make sure the interviewer asks the same questions to get consistent results.  Varying the questions makes it difficult to find patterns in the results.*


  F﻿rom each of the interviews, the information should be aggregated and synthesize into one or two sentences to be review with sponsors or executives.  Depending on the number of sponsors or executives, the review could be handled via email or a short meeting.  If there are several participants, the a workshop approach is most likely a better option.  Results from an interview process with multiple interviewees can be used as the initial draft(s) of the mission statement.


  **Practice/Workshop**


  A﻿ mission practice or workshop follows a similar approach to the interviews.  All of the main concept questions are address as a group.  There are a couple of ways to approach this workshop.  


  The first approach is good for small number of executives/leaders.  Using a white board, stickies or online collaboration tool, address each question by giving the participants 10 - 15 minutes of individual time for each question.  Once all of the questions have been answered, post all answers for each question in place where everyone cab view them.  Address each question and come to a consensus statement.  As a team, create a mission statement us

whatIs: It is a practice that focuses on the teams and people of the
  organization in order to collect information about which are the main and most
  complex systems in the organization that need transformational work to
  strengthen the structures of the company and spread the knowledge among the
  teams on topics such as Culture, Technology, DevOps and Design Thinking. An
  activity that acts in the breaking of silos and acts directly in the
  strengthening of the people who work within the organization, involving them
  in a sense of belonging and providing a deepening of the team for immersion in
  a transformational and continuous journey.
whyDo: >-
  Many organizations find it very difficult to list within their structure a
  system for the digital transformation journey, and this is due to numerous
  factors and one of these factors is that we do not really know what the
  problems are with each system around us and its real importance to the
  organization.


  This practice has as the main focus to unite the different teams within an organization in order to ask four questions of extreme importance for all members to look inside the organization and bring the most relevant systems (important for the organization, which has a great pain) for a team approach and clarification providing everyone with a mutual and common understanding about them, this facilitates the team prioritization process of what is really most important and in generating a priority pipeline for the organization that can work to solve them in a great journey of digital transformation.


  **Questions:**


  * *How is your operation?*

  * *What is your pain?*

  * *What is your strategy?*

  * *What is the value of a system or process?*
howTo: >-
  The practice should start with an introduction to what it is and how it is
  covered during its application:


  * It is a tool that facilitates conversations about relative priorities and focuses the team's focus on defining which system should be approached first in a transformational journey;

  * Clarifies the importance of the systems chosen among all the teams involved for team cohesion;

  * A practice that increases team autonomy;

  * A practice that breaks the integration silos between the teams, bringing the sense of belonging of a digital transformation journey to the organization;


  This practice helps the client to find possible use cases, strengthening the understanding of problems, and helping to create a pipeline of priorities within the organization, the focus is dedicated to the systems that currently exist. So we asked the following questions:


  1. How is your operation: Here we ask the teams/people to survey the main systems used in the corporation and to think about how their operation works. How difficult or easy it is to operate the system, how are the teams' silos, especially if it exists and how is the operation between multiple teams;


  2. What is your pain: Here we invite teams/people to look inside the organization and think about what their pain is when we talk about the system or processes, which systems are of great relevance and bring enormous pain to the organization;


  3. What is your strategy: Here we invite the teams/people of the organization to start reflecting on how they are currently positioned and how they want to start their journey of transformation. The big question is "Thinking about the future of the organization as you see your journey in the next 3, 6, 12, or 18 months".


  4. What is the value of a system or process: Here we ask teams/people to think, based on the systems raised above, what value this tool adds to the corporation and the current work process;


  After everyone has understood the questions, let's start the next step, which is to ask team/people to create post-it notes with the name of the system, and inform them that there is no problem if the system names are repeated, the important thing is to be able to capture the that in the view of the teams/people of the organization believe that it has the highest priority in the next 6 months to 12 months of the organization we dedicate a minimum time so that it is possible to create the post-it notes.


  After that part, we got a big step in the organization, we broke the silos and everyone was able to express what is important in their point of view for the organization, so now we open a session for each member of the discovery to talk about the system they put in and the because, during this process, the facilitator and the facilitator's support team must create several post-it notes with keywords about what is being said about the system, such as the focus of mapping their problem. Through this process, we are creating a system pipeline and its problems, which could be our big case for the beginning of a journey.


  Everyone will speak their point of view before the systems they put in, the focus is to foster enormous knowledge for everyone about the perspective of each system that was spoken by the members of the discovery, so we opened a voting session where each member is entitled to 3 votes to return to the systems he considers to be of great importance to the organization and must be addressed first on a transformational journey. From now on we have a pipeline of prioritized systems, and we know which systems are the most important and we managed to have a priority to deal with as a case of the transformational journey.


  The proprietary system may be the case, or it may be some of the systems that we manage to prioritize, the great value gained here is that we have worked for a great transformational journey and we can help the organization over time to achieve its goals.

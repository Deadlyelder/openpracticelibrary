whatIs: >-
  Mentorship as a general practice is one of the oldest forms of spreading
  knowledge between people. In this version of the practice we leverage the use
  of visual boards to provide clarity and alignment to the mentor and the
  mentee. This practice is intended to be leveraged on an as needed basis, it’s
  expected that for each mentorship there may be elements of the practice that
  are less relevant. It is worth noting that mentorships may be completely
  informal, this practice is designed to support mentorships that would benefit
  from lightweight structure.



  This framing of Mentorship has been developed based of research and co-designed by the remote:af community.
whyDo: Mentorship can provide organisations with reinforced channels of
  information outside of hierarchy and providing ongoing learning and
  development between people. As a learning and development practice,
  mentorships are effective in providing nuanced career growth for the mentor
  and the mentee.
howTo: >-
  Mentorships can often be non-linear, over the course of a given mentorship you
  may find the roles between mentor and mentee shift and change. To support a
  wider range of contexts the practice has been segmented into three domains;


  * Alignment – between the Mentor and Mentee

  * Sessions – that facilitate growth and learning

  * Reflection – on the mentorship and how it’s evolved


  Examples of each section completed is provided in the images section.


  ## A﻿lignment


  ### S﻿tory.Me Cards


  Rapport is the cornerstone of relationships between people. The Story.Me Cards are a light exercise that encourages self-disclosures within boundaries to help people get to know each other better. This practice focuses specifically on the mentorship itself, if you don’t use Story.Me Cards as a rapport building exercise then it’s highly recommended to allow space for the mentor and mentee get to know each other. A link to the Story.Me Cards available on the Miroverse is listed below the practice.




  ### Mentor/ Mentee Context


  The first activity in this practice is allowing space for the Mentor and the Mentee to explore what they hope to achieve from the mentorship. This activity combined with the Story.Me Cards can useful preparation work for the first mentoring session.




  #### M﻿otivations


  The six questions in this section are posed to encourage reflection for the Mentor/Mentee. 


  1. What about your history is important to you?

  2. What is the most rewarding work you’ve done?

  3. What have you found exciting in the past year?

  4. What do you hope to focus on in the future?

  5. What will you find rewarding about your focus?

  6. What about your focus is going to be exciting?


  Capture at least one answer to each question in the spaces provided on the card.




  #### P﻿otential Goals


  Reflect on your motivations and brainstorm some potential goals you’d like to achieve through this mentorship. Look for themes in your answers from the motivations section to get inspiration. It’s helpful to be ambitious here, since the Mentor/Mentee will agree on goals in the Mentorship Agreement.




  #### B﻿oundaries


  An effective mentorship needs boundaries to maintain focus. This will also help the mentor and the mentee explore any conflicts in expectations at the start of the mentorship. Capture in the boundaries section any topics or concerns you have with the mentorship. It’s important to include considerations about confidentiality, limitations on personal inquiry and methods for sharing feedback.

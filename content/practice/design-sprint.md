## What is it?

It is a 5 day customer-centric process for rapidly solving big challenges, creating new products, or improving existing ones. 

Design sprints enable you to:

* Clarify the problem at hand, and identify the needs of potential users
* Explore solutions through brainstorming and sketching exercises
* Distil your ideas into one or two solutions that you can test
* Prototype your solution and bring it to life
* Test the prototype with people who would use it

The process phases include: Understand, Define, Sketch, Decide, Prototype and Validate.

## Why use it?

The aim is to fast-forward into the future to see your finished product and customer reactions, before making any expensive commitment. This reduces risks when bringing a new product, service or a feature to the market. Design Sprints are the fastest way to find out if a product or project is worth undertaking, if a feature is worth the effort, or if your value proposition is really valid. 

It compresses potentially months of work into one week and importantly tests the design idea and provides real user feedback in rapid fashion.

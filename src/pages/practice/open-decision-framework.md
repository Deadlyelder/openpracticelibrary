  Open decision making is an approach to arriving at actionable agreements
  through participatory practices.


  According to the Open Decision Framework, open decision making is **transparent**, **inclusive**, and **customer-centric**. It involves clearly sharing problems, requirements, and constraints with affected parties; collaborating purposefully with multiple stakeholders to secure diverse opinions and comprehensive feedback; and managing relationships and expectations across competing needs and priorities.


  More generally, open decisions facilitate well-functioning meritocracies. Open source communities are meritocratic to the extent that they pragmatically value concrete contributions over formal titles and encourage ideas from all corners of an organization.


  \

  The Open Decision Framework illustrates how to take five open source principles--open exchange, participation, meritocracy, community, and “release early, release often”--and put them into practice throughout the process of making a decision or leading a project. The framework is flexible and offers practical steps designed to help teams collaborate with each other, identify and engage stakeholders, manage competing needs and priorities, communicate tradeoffs and business requirements, and improve decision-making.

whyDo: >-
  The framework can help decision-makers communicate transparently, seek out
  diverse perspectives, collaborate more effectively across distributed teams,
  and limit unanticipated impacts of business projects and decisions.


  Red Hat's open culture – rooted in transparency, collaboration and meritocracy – was highlighted in *The Open Organization*, by Jim Whitehurst, the company's president and CEO. 


  Red Hat created the Open Decision Framework to help sustain and scale its open culture as it grew. As interest in open source – both in technology and as the basis of open management and culture – has taken off, Red Hat created the Open Decision Framework to empower business leaders, decision-makers, and project managers to learn from the experiences of Red Hatters and contribute their own findings back to the community.
howTo: >-
  The Open Decision Framework lists four steps (or "phases") that constitute the
  open decision-making process:


  1. Ideation

  2. Planning and research

  3. Design, development, and testing

  4. Launch


  You can use the Open Decision Framework with your teams today! Simply [download copies available online](https://opensource.com/open-organization/16/6/introducing-open-decision-framework). You can read the [plain text version](https://github.com/red-hat-people-team/open-decision-framework/blob/master/ODF-community.md) and even download [presentation slides](https://github.com/red-hat-people-team/open-decision-framework/blob/master/ODF-community.pdf) that explain the framework.


  You might also consider sharing the framework with your team's or organization's leadership. Track your team's progress using the [Open Decision Framework Maturity Model](https://github.com/red-hat-people-team/open-decision-framework/blob/master/maturity-model/Maturity-model-ODF.pdf)




  ### The framework is powered by  open source principles:


  **Open exchange**


  Whether you're developing software or trying to solve a business problem, open exchange begins when you share your "source code" with others. A free exchange of ideas is critical to creating an environment where people can learn and use existing information to develop new ideas.


  **Participation**


  When we are free to collaborate, we create. We can solve problems that no one person may be able to solve on their own. And when we can implement open standards, we enable others to participate in the future.


  **Release early + often**


  Rapid prototypes can lead to rapid failures, and that leads to better solutions faster. When you're free to experiment, you can look at problems in new ways and look for answers in new places. You can learn by doing.


  **Meritocracy**


  In a meritocracy, good ideas can come from anywhere, and the best ideas win. Everyone has access to the same information. Successful work determines which projects rise and gather support and effort from the community.


  **Community**


  Communities form around a common purpose. They bring together diverse ideas and share work. Together, a global community can create beyond the capabilities of any one individual. It multiplies effort and shares the work. Together, we can do more.

  15/5 reports are a great way to keep a pulse across teams and organisations. They should take no more than 15 minutes to write, and no more than 5 minutes to read.
whyDo: Ensuring that everyone knows what's going on in an organisation can be
  hard. None of us want to spend lots of time writing or reading reports, but
  only communicating verbally can take a lot of time and risk losing granularity
  or accuracy of information.
howTo: >-
  You will probably want to use different questions to the below, and you should
  also evolve your questions as you and your teams evolve too.


  Use the below as a starting point though, and see how you get on. There should be around three "mandatory" questions (though people are free to state "I have nothing to report on", or similar; and you can include a few optional questions that add extra context and ideas.


  Example questions:\

  \

  **What are your main achievements this week? What are you most proud of or satisfied with?**


  \

  This question means the report starts with highlighting success. And people should be encouraged to add non-work achievements too.




  **How are you feeling about the teams you're in and the wider organisation?**




  This question may take weeks or months before people begin to answer honestly and safely, but it's really important. This is one of the key ways you can keep a pulse on the team culture.




  **Is there anything worrying or concerning you in or outside of work?**




  Same old stuff, nothing serious




  **How are you feeling, and what is the morale of your team around you?**




  Going ok, happy to have good team mates that are always there to cheer me up , specially Neil




  **Is there anything I could be doing better, differently or more of that would help you?**




  As always doing a great job to keep us motivated and in a great environment






  **Optional questions:**




  **Where are you facing any challenges or blockages?**




  Google documentation is not that straightforward, but I managed to do what I needed to do ![ðŸ˜€](https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f600)




  What have you learned this week?




  Google api and their confusing documentation




  **What would you change about the work environment, the team, or the organisation?**

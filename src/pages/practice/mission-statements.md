whatIs: The Mission statement is the starting point of crafting a strategy for
  any type of organization, entity. It can be used as part of a large customer
  engagement as well. It is a brief statement (typically one or two sentences)
  that defines why the organization exists. It should be an inspirational, clear
  statement that explains and drives the organization to an overall strategic
  destination.
whyDo: A Mission statement defines the fundamental purpose of an organization,
  entity or engagement. It should inform executives and employees about the
  overall goal they have come together to realize as a team. It serves as the
  ultimate alignment tool for what the organization is trying to accomplish.
howTo: >-
  The Mission Statement can be created from a client meeting, series of
  interviews, standalone facilitated practice or as part of a workshop. The goal
  of this process is to identify the overarching reason why the organization,
  entity or engagement was originally established.


  Interviews


  During interviews with customer sponsors for an engagement or executives of an entity, the interviewer should focus on main concepts in crafting a Mission statement. Those concepts are address via the questions listed below:


  1. Why do we exist?

  2. Who does the organization/engagement serve?

  3. Why does the organization/engagement care?


  H﻿int: Use the questions above as a start to an interview guide for each executive. Make sure the interviewer asks the same questions to get consistent results. Varying the questions makes it difficult to find patterns in the results.


  From each of the interviews, the information should be aggregated and synthesized into one or two sentences to be reviewed with sponsors or executives. Depending on the number of sponsors or executives, the review could be handled via email or a short meeting. If there are several participants, the a workshop approach is most likely a better option. Results from an interview process with multiple interviewees can be used as the initial draft(s) of the mission statement.


  Practice/Workshop


  A﻿ mission practice or workshop follows a similar approach to the interviews. All of the main concept questions are addressed as a group. There are a couple of ways to approach this workshop.


  The first approach is good for a small number of executives/leaders. Using a white board, stickies or online collaboration tool, address each question by giving the participants 10 - 15 minutes of individual time for each question. Once all of the questions have been answered, post all answers for each question in place where everyone can view them. With the team, address each question and come to a consensus statement. Using those statements, have the team draft one or more mission statements for everyone to review. Review and edit the mission statement until you get consensus. Once the final mission statement is agreed to, try asking these questions as a litmus test:


  * Would you wear the Mission statement on a T-shirt?

  * Would your associates/staff wear the Mission statement on a T-shirt?

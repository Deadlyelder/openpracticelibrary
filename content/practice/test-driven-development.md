## What is it?

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle. Requirements are turned into test cases, where the software is developed to pass the tests. In other words, it creates a safety net that serves to keep the developer's problems/bugs at bay while enabling the developer to refactor efficiently. This is opposed to software development that allows software to be added that is not proven to meet requirements.

## Why use it?

* Allows developers to create smaller units of improvement as initially code should only aim to pass the tests
* Leads to more modular and flexible code as it will be developed in smaller independent units
* Faster feedback that can for example tell you whether your last change (or refactoring) has broken previously working codes
* Creates a detailed specification

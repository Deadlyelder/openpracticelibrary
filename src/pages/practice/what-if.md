whatIs: The "What If..." practice is a team activity seeks to identify the
  current "rules" or "norms" surrounding a particular challenge, then eliminate
  one of those rules or norms to broaden the spectrum of innovative ideas. This
  practice was created by former Head of Innovation and Creativity at Disney,
  Duncan Wardle, and was heavily used during his time at the company.
whyDo: This practice is a proven activity for lightly challenging peoples'
  mental barriers surrounding a particular business challenge. These mental
  barriers, or "river of thinking," forms over time as we work in a particular
  industry. Through our experiences, we subconciously begin to form patterns in
  what we think something should look like, and these patterns begin to form
  boundaries for creativity. The "What If..." practice seeks to identify those
  boundaries and experiment with removing one of them so we can find even more
  creative and innovative ideas to problem solving.

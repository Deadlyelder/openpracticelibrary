## What is it?

This is a workshop exercise that you can use for ALMOST ANYTHING involving getting a few people in a room to define and solve challenges. It's a handful of practices you run in order with a group to identify pain points or problems to solve, prioritizing those problems, ideating solutions to the most important problems, prioritizing those solutions, then assigning next-steps for the team to take in order to run a solution experiment.

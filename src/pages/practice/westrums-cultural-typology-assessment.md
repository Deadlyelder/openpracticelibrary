  We talk a lot about organisational culture, team cultures, and "good" or "bad"
  cultures. And we also talk a lot about "culture change". But changing
  something is hard if you don't know whether you're having any effect, and
  can't describe the thing you're changing. Ron Westrum in his paper "A typology
  of organisational cultures" (2004) described three foundational cultural
  "typologies" that the majority of organisations could be aligned to:


  **Pathological** (power-oriented): These organisations are characterised by low cooperation across groups and a culture of blame. Information is often withheld for personal gain. 


  **Bureaucratic** (rule-oriented): Bureaucratic cultures are preoccupied with rules and positions, and responsibilities are compartmentalised by the department, with little concern for the overall mission of the organisation.


  **Generative** (performance-oriented): The hallmarks of a generative organisation are good information flow, high cooperation and trust, collaboration ("bridging") between teams, and conscious inquiry.\

  You can see a break down of the characteristics of the each culture in this table:




  | **Pathological**              | **Bureaucratic**          | **Generative**             |

  | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |

  | ***Power oriented***          | ***Rule oriented***       | ***Performance oriented*** |

  | Low cooperation               | Modest cooperation        | High cooperation           |

  | Messengers “shot”             | Messengers neglected      | Messengers trained         |

  | Responsibilities shirked      | Narrow responsibilities   | Risks are shared           |

  | Bridging discouraged          | Bridging tolerated        | Bridging encouraged        |

  | Failure leads to scapegoating | Failure leads to justice  | Failure leads to inquiry   |

  | Novelty crushed               | Novelty leads to problems | Novelty implemented        |




  Ron Westrum describes a culture of "safety" in Generative organisations, and it's easy to see how psychological safety is both increased in, and fundamental to, Generative cultures. Amy Edmondson, in 2009, described "Learning Organisations" in her paper "\*\**"

whatIs: Abstraction Laddering is a problem-framing activity that has
  participants reconsider problem statements by broadening or narrowing its
  focus. Participants brainstorm and explore "how" and "why" statements
  generated from the initial problem statement in order to explore context,
  possibilities, and potentially reframe the original problem statement to one
  that is more compelling or broader in nature.
whyDo: Taking time to explore a given problem statement can help you reframe the
  statement in a way that better lends itself to innovative thinking. Of course,
  sometimes at the end of this activity it is decided that the original problem
  statement was the best, and in that case you at least explored other options
  to validate the current wording. But in many cases, the problem statement is
  reworded or reframed in a way that broadens the aperture of creative
  solutions, allowing for more ideas and increasing the creative potential of
  your solution.

  Steps to facilitate this practice:


  1. Identify an initial problem statement

  2. On a whiteboard or digital whiteboarding tool (if facilitating remotely), draw a ladder with multiple rungs. If facilitating in person, ensure each participant has a pad of stickies and a sharpie

  3. Write your initial problem statement in the middle rung

  4. Ask the group to write down 3 reasons as to WHY we want to solve this problem and 3 reasons HOW they might solve the problem (each reason on its own stickie)

  U﻿biquitous Language is a practice of building up a canonical, rigorous and
  unambigous language between everyone involved in the software development
  process. Usually a common shared language between the development team and the
  users, but not limited to that. The product owner and other stakeholders
  should adopt it as well.


  I﻿t comes from the Domain Driven Design world. I﻿t was first introduced by Eric Evans in his own book ["Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software"](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321125215/domainlanguag-20) in 2003.

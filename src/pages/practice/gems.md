whatIs: "Created by Kathy Keating, GEMs (**G**oal : **E**xperiments :
  **M**easures) provide an approach to objective setting and measurement. It is
  an alternative to OKRs (**O**bjective **K**ey **R**esults) and SMART
  (**S**pecific **M**easurable **A**chievable **R**elevant **T**ime bound)
  goals."
whyDo: >-
  The thorny world of objective setting can kill a team's drive. Different
  people gravitate towards different models, but it is generally agreed that top
  down, cascaded objectives deserve to rot in the 90's. As teams move towards
  greater autonomy, translating the purpose and vision into meaningful and
  measurable activities can be uncomfortable at best. Enter GEMs - **G**oal :
  **E**xperiments : **M**easures.


  Many of the practices within the Open Practice Library encourage the adoption of a 'culture of experimentation'; GEMs fit perfectly with that mindset. Many feel OKRs lack the path to get from the objective to the key result and we've all struggled to write SMART objectives, felt stupid and then put them in the draw until review time, but GEMs help to address these difficulties and discomfort by making the experiments we wish to undertake to achieve the objectives, explicit. Best of all, if outside of your team (or even within it) OKRs or SMART objectives are being used, it's easy to take GEMs and re-phrase into either OKRs or SMART objectives.
howTo: 1) Take a goal - this must be relevant and achievable for both
  individuals and teams to influence. The goal should be something that it is
  understood why we're looking to achieve it

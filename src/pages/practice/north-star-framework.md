whatIs: >-
  Creating a shared purpose for a product can be achieved by setting a North
  Star. The\

  North Star Framework is a model for managing products by identifying a single, crucial\

  metric known as the North Star Metric. According to Sean Ellis, who coined this term,\

  this is the single metric that best captures the core value that your product delivers to \[its]\

  customers
whyDo: >-
  [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/north-star) is a digital analytics company
  that has freely released an excellent playbook regarding the North Star
  Framework â€“ what it is, why you might use it, and how to use it. 


  It lists the following seven checklist points about what a North Star Metric is:


  1. It expresses value. We can see why it matters to customers reflected in it

  2. It represents vision and strategy. Our company's product and business strategy are

  3. It's a leading indicator of success. It predicts future results, rather than reflecting past results.

  4. It's actionable. We can take action to influence it.

  5. It's understandable. It's framed in plain language that non-technical partners can understand.

  6. It's measurable. We can instrument our products to track it.

  7. It's not a vanity metric. When it changes, we can be confident that the change is meaningful and valuable, rather than being something that doesn't actually predict long-term success, even if it makes the team feel good about itself.


  Using the North Star practice during a discovery loop can help set teams off in the right direction and achieve alignment between all its members and its stakeholders. It can also help teams achieve course correction or re-alignment if they've been running without a North Star. Having a North Star's information radiated on the wall and clearly in view of team members and interested stakeholders can help maintain focus on it and steer the team toward it.

  To help find a North Star, we make use of a simple canvas, such as the one
  provided in Amplitude's playbook:

  A team using the North Star Framework identifies a single, meaningful metric and a handful of contributing inputs. Product teams work to influence those inputs, which, in turn, drive the metric. The North Star is a leading indicator of sustainable growth and acts as connective tissue between the product and the broader business.

whatIs: Cognitive walkthrough is an effective method for evaluating usability
  and accessibility. Compared to other methods, it is easy, effective and cheap
  to perform.
whyDo: >-
  Lack of digital accessibility and poor usability are costly due to inefficient
  use, training and support costs. It is also not cost-effective to correct the
  deficiencies once the service has been launched.


  The cognitive walkthrough gives you:


  * Concrete feedback on usability, accessibility and design

  * Suggestions on how you can make your service better

  * Help identify potential problems in all phases of the development process

  * Insights into how to conduct work with accessibility and usability in a structured way
howTo: >-
  ## The development team's preparation


  1. Get someone to assess your current service accessibility level using a WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) assessment tool of your choice. Use this report as a way of understanding the technical debt that might exist.

  2. Provide a link to the prototype or test environment to the users you want to try your service on.

  3. Book an appointment for a review, on-site/hybrid/distance with users that are new to your service or might have been in contact with your support for accessability reasons


  ## Implementation


  The development team and some users of your choice meet and together go through the service step by step at a leisurely pace.


  Make an effort to review each step from a usability and accessibility perspective and based on current requirements, guidelines and recommendations.


  Compile a report with an action plan.


  *Celebrate that you have started working on accessibility and usability, which will lead to better results for your service!*

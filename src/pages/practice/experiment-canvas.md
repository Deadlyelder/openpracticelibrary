  T﻿he Experiment Canvas, created by Chris Stone, is a practice and artifact
  that helps teams design focused experiments with clear guardrails around
  scope, involvement, timeframe, and success criteria. It's a great tool to use
  when a team has:


  a﻿) a problem they want to solve


  b﻿) an idea they want to implement
whyDo: When a team fills out an experiment canvas together, it forces
  conversations that require the team to make decisions about specific areas
  that make up a well-designed experiment. By the end, all teams members have a
  clear sense of what's being done, thereby improving alignment, clarity, and
  speed while instilling a culture of ideation, collaboration, and
  experimentation as the vehicle to continuous improvement 💡 👩‍🔬 📈 🥳

whatIs: >-
  Weighted Shortest Job First, WSJF, is a method for assessing the items which
  are the most valuable and the smallest job size, to infer work items we should
  prioritise and deliver first. This follows a fairly straightforward formula as
  follows:


  WSJF = Cost of Delay รท Job Size


  Where the Cost of Delay, CoD, is (Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction or Opportunity Enablement)


  This practice was established by Don Reinertson in the "Principles of Product Development Flow" as an evolution of the 'shortest job first' method used previously. It has been popularised in the Scaled Agile Framework methodology, supporting many of its guiding principles.
whyDo: >-
  This practice is a great way of taking big, unrefined work items, driving down
  details and establishing a shared and objective priority, which can be easily
  communicated to stakeholders and other interested parties.


  In running this exercise with the whole team, a more rounded view of the priority and sequencing is established; bringing the team closer to the urgency for working on particular items vs others.
howTo: Start by scoring the components of the Cost of Delay

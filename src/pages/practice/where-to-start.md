  This practice has the focus on the teams in an organization to help them
  extract pieces of information about the most complex systems or processes that
  need to pass urgently for transformational work to strengthen the organization
  and diffuse the knowledge of Design Thinking, Agile, and DevOps Culture.


  * It is a tool that facilitates conversations about relative priorities and focuses the team on defining which system should be approached first in a transformational journey;

  * Clarifies the importance of the systems chosen among all the teams involved for team cohesion;

  * An exercise that increases team autonomy;

  * A practice that breaks the integration silos between the teams, bringing the sense of belonging of a journey of digital transformation to the organization;
whyDo: >-
  Many organizations have extraordinary difficulty discovering where to start a
  transformational and continuous journey to the new digital world era, and this
  is a dilemma for these organizations. 


  ***The longer the company takes time to look ahead, can the path be further from the transformation?*** 


  In a digital transformation, the people are the most crucial thing, and empower her is the key to success. Together these people know everything about the business and the better path for  the organization.


  The **Where To Start** is a disruptive practice with a total focus on people enabling them to express their feelings about the processes, systems encouraging the participants to work together to choose the new path.
howTo: >-
  Participants should focus on answering questions that will help to better
  address the points of cultural and digital transformation:


  ***How is your operation?

  What is the value of this system or process?

  What is your pain?

  What is your strategy?***


  1 - We start the practice with relative priorities and concentrating the team's focus on defining which system should be approached first in a transformational journey;



  2 - Everyone should think together by putting post-its to draw how the operation performed by users is with the systems, user areas, and the process involved;



  3 - Classify the value obtained, the main pains they have, and their desire to improve each system or process raised in the design of the process;



  4 - After that, the participants should think about how they would like to distribute these improvements in an estimated timeline, prioritizing the most important ones and what they would like to do first.


  **Optional:**

  Practices such as [Priority Slides](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/priority-sliders/) can be used to prioritize improvements to the systems or processes to be focused on the timeline.

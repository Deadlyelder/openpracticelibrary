whatIs: Start each session by inviting everyone to speak in turn, uninterrupted,
  for an agreed amount of time.  What they say is less important than the fact
  they be allowed to say it, and that it is easily heard by everyone.
whyDo: >-
  Why is this important? It gives everyone a chance to speak and share. It tests
  out microphones etc and sets the expectation that everyone can talk. 


  Check-ins also help teams begin their work together with a sense of presence and purpose.
howTo: >-
  Simply ask the following:


  * How are you doing?

  * How are you really doing?

  * Random non-work related question e.g.: What do you hope to get out of this call/meeting/workshop?

  * Pass on to someone else :)


  If you're pairing this with a standup, the following questions are great for sharing information and for accountability and creating feedback loops!


  * What are your intentions for the day?

  * How did yesterday’s intentions go?

  * Do you see any blockers to our progress?

  * What’s something that you’re grateful for in the team?

  * What’s one thing you’d like help/advice with?

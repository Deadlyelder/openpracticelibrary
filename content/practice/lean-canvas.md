# What is it?

The lean canvas template is a one -pager, which captures key information about your future product, what problem it will solve, who are your customers, how will you distribute it and how you will make money from it.

## Why use it?

Ash Maurya modified the Business Model Canvas (by Alexander Osterwalder) with the aim to shorten the product development lifecycle and rapidly discover if the proposed business model is viable.

It will help you establish if your product or service idea has merits.

When filling out the canvas it is best to fill them out in a certain way. 

1. Problem section: \
   When filling out the problem section: Think with your future customer in mind. WHY is this a problem for him?
2. Target Customer section: \
   Who are your early adopters of your product, specify them in terms of demographics, situation and interest.
3. Unique Value Preposition (UVP) and High Level Concepts (HLC): \
   UVP is directed to your customer, HLC is geared to investors, which can help you pitching your product: Shazam for mushrooms
4. Solution Box:\
   The Solution box focuses on the key features of your product or service. Ideally, each aspect of the solution comes in line with one of the previously mentioned problems.









Ensure to use bullet points – not long sentences – a good canvas should be understood in a few minutes

Make sure you are filling out every box, there might be a lot of uncertainty but the canvas is there to help you.

whatIs: >-
  This is a facilitated workshop that communicates or validates existing or
  helps establish new strategies to reach the specified goal(s) while also
  taking into consideration detractors / challenges with reagard to culture and
  execution. 


  If goals need to be established first then you can start off with

whyDo: >-
  This is where the rubber hits the road, marrying lofty goals and strategies
  with the reality of culture, people, communication, team structure, metrics,
  and more.


  When goals and associated strategies are formulated this exercise allows for immediate 'reality checks' and surfaces potential challenges and roadblocks that must be paid attention to. This allows to plan for risk mitigation strategies right from the start.
howTo: >-
  Once the goal(s) are agreed upon I'd suggest to run a 10-for-10 exercise to
  bring out new strategies. \

  If the strategies are already existing then the SME's need to present the existing strategies and the related goals those strategies are in support of.


  After the goals and strategies have been agreed upon the facilitator can allow between 3 - 7  minutes to flush out the challenges (and bright spots if necessary) in the execution and culture area.

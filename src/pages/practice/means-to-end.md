whatIs: The Means to End practice helps define, differentiate, and communicate
  an organisational Vision, Strategy, and the associated tactical
  implementations through projects and initiatives (Tactics). Participants
  define and explore the relationship and dependencies between the Visionary,
  Strategic and Tactical layers.
whyDo: Taking time to explore the meaning and correlation between Mission,
  Vision, Strategies and Objectives helps organisations to empower their teams
  and people, which in turn creates a culture in support of a high performing
  organisation ([Ron

howTo: >-
  Firstly, clearly state the differences between Objective (Tactical layer) and
  Goal (strategic layer). Different frameworks have different defintions, so
  it's important to level set prior to starting this practice.


  Start off with the **Visionary Layer** with a [10-for-10 brainstorm](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/10-for-10/) or even better with a [Start with Why.](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/start-with-why/)


  Ask the group:


  * Vision: What will our organisation / team look like in 2 to 5 years from now? Does that serve our purpose?

  * Mission: What are we doing on a daily basis to achieve our Vision? And life our purpose?


  Ensure that each Mission directly and clearly links to the Vision statement. If it doesn't it might be in the wrong layer, unrelated or the Vision might be incomplete or out of date.


  Then move into the **Strategic Layer**. First the strategic goals need to be established, for which you can use another 10-for-10 brainstorm, or better [Start at the End](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/start-at-the-end/). Once the Goals are agreed upon, map the Goals back to the Vision statement and articulate how each goal supports the Vision. Once the goals and Vision are clearly linked, the next step is an Impact Mapping exercise that establishes the related strategies linked to each strategic Goal. Once all goals and corresponding strategies are established, the strategies need to be linked back to the Mission and make sense.


  Once you are done, pat yourself on the back. The hardest part is complete.
